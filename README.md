## Contribute
It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes
isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first
time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what's better than actually doing the stuff in a practice
environment? This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way beginners make their first contribution. If
you are looking to make your first contribution, follow the steps below.
